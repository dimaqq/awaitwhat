# Await, What?

Tell you what waits for what in an `async/await` program.

### Alpine

You'll need `apk add build-base openssl-dev libffi-dev`

## Sprint Setup

Comms: https://gitter.im/awaitwhat/community

* Python 3.9, Python 3.8 (preferred) or Python 3.7
* Your platform dev tools (compiler, etc).
* Ensure that `python` is 3.9 or 3.8 or 3.7
* Install `poetry`
* Install `graphviz`
* Clone this repository
* Look at [tests](https://github.com/dimaqq/awaitwhat/tree/master/test)
* Look at [issues](https://github.com/dimaqq/awaitwhat/issues)

```console
> python --version
Python 3.9.0b4  #ðŸ§¡
Python 3.8.4    #ðŸ‘Œ

> dot -V
dot - graphviz version 2.40.1

> curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
# add ~/.poetry/bin to your PATH

> git clone git@github.com:dimaqq/awaitwhat.git
> cd awaitwhat
~/awaitwhat (dev|âœ”) > poetry shell    # creates a venv and drops you in it

(awaitwhat-x-py3.9) ~/awaitwhat (dev|âœ”) > poetry install  # installs projects dependencies in a venv
(awaitwhat-x-py3.9) ~/awaitwhat (dev|âœ”) > poetry build    # builds a C extension in this project

(awaitwhat-x-py3.9) ~/awaitwhat (dev|âœ”) > env PYTHONPATH=. python examples/test_shield.py | tee graph.dot
(awaitwhat-x-py3.9) ~/awaitwhat (dev|âœ”) > dot -Tsvg graph.dot -o graph.svg
(awaitwhat-x-py3.9) ~/awaitwhat (dev|âœ”) > open graph.svg  # or load it in a browser
```

### TL;DR

Say you have this code:
```py

async def job():
    await foo()


async def foo():
    await bar()


async def bar():
    await baz()


async def baz():
    await leaf()


async def leaf():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # imagine you don't know this


async def work():
    await asyncio.gather(..., job())
```

Now that code is stuck and and you want to know why.

#### Python built-in
```py
Stack for <Task pending coro=<job() â€¦> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[<TaskWakeupMethWrapper â€¦>()]> cb=[â€¦]> (most recent call last):
  File "test/test_stack.py", line 34, in job
    await foo()
```

#### This library
```py
Stack for <Task pending coro=<job() â€¦> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[<TaskWakeupMethWrapper â€¦>()]> cb=[â€¦]> (most recent call last):
  File "test/test_stack.py", line 34, in job
    await foo()
  File "test/test_stack.py", line 38, in foo
    await bar()
  File "test/test_stack.py", line 42, in bar
    await baz()
  File "test/test_stack.py", line 46, in baz
    await leaf()
  File "test/test_stack.py", line 50, in leaf
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
  File "/â€¦/asyncio/tasks.py", line 568, in sleep
    return await future
  File "<Sentinel>", line 0, in <_asyncio.FutureIter object at 0x7fb6981690d8>: â€¦
```

> Hi group,

> I'm recently debugging a long-running asyncio program that appears to get stuck about once a week.

> The tools I've discovered so far are:
> * high level: `asyncio.all_tasks()` + `asyncio.Task.get_stack()`
> * low level: `loop._selector._fd_to_key`
>
> What's missing is the middle level, i.e. stack-like linkage of what is waiting for what. For a practical example, consider:
>
> ```py
> async def leaf(): await somesocket.recv()
> async def baz(): await leaf()
> async def bar(): await baz()
> async def foo(): await bar()
> async def job(): await foo()
> async def work(): await asyncio.gather(..., job())
> async def main(): asyncio.run(work())
> ```
>
> The task stack will contain:
> * main and body of work with line number
> * job task with line number pointing to foo
>
> The file descriptor mapping, socket fd, `loop._recv()` and a `Future`.
>
> What's missing are connections `foo->bar->baz->leaf`.
> That is, I can't tell which task is waiting for what terminal `Future`.
>
> Is this problem solved in some way that I'm not aware of?
> Is there a library or external tool for this already?
>
> Perhaps, if I could get a list of all pending coroutines, I could figure out what's wrong.

> If no such API exists, I'm thinking of the following:

> ```py
> async def foo():
>     await bar()
>
> In [37]: dis.dis(foo)
>   1           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (bar)
>               2 CALL_FUNCTION            0
>               4 GET_AWAITABLE
>               6 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
>               8 YIELD_FROM
>              10 POP_TOP
>              12 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
>              14 RETURN_VALUE
> ```
>
> Starting from a pending task, I'd get it's coroutine and:
>
> Get the coroutine frame, and if current instruction is `YIELD_FROM`, then the reference to the awaitable should be on the top of the stack.
> If that reference points to a pending coroutine, I'd add that to the "forward trace" and repeat.
>
> At some point I'd reach an awaitable that's not a pending coroutine, which may be: another `Task` (I already got those), a low-level `Future` (can be looked up in event loop), an `Event` (tough luck, shoulda logged all `Event`'s on creation) or a dozen other corner cases.
